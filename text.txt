Hi! My name is Will.
I'm a student and aspiring web developer.

So, what am I doing right now?
B.S. in Computer Science at Missouri S&T
Graduating in May 2025, I have been active in many campus organizations, like the Mars Rover Design Team. This year, I lead the BaseStation sub-team.

Project Manager at St. Louis Family Church
I am blessed to have the opportunity to work remotely on projects at my home church in Chesterfield, Missouri in my free time. I have been attending St. Louis Family Church for many years and have been on staff since July 2021.

Cyber Security Engineer Intern at the National Geospatial-Intelligence Agency
In the summer of 2023, I was presented the opportunity to work full time at the NGA as a student intern. Through this I was able to better understand the skills needed in Cyber Security and network with professionals in that field.
